## Purpose
I created these files as a way to better understand bitwise operators and practical use
When developers are challenged by memory limitation or have high speed requirement as for
embedded systems (FR : systemes embarques) like drones, bitwise operators come in handy.

* 1.0 Introduction to <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators/blob/master/1.0_introduction.c">Bitwises operators.</a>
* 1.1 Learn how to <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators/blob/master/1.1_printing_bits.c">print (display) bits.</a>
* 1.2 Learn how to <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators/blob/master/1.2_reverse_bits.c">reverse a byte.</a>
* 1.3 Check if <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators/blob/master/1.3_is_power_of_2.c">a number is power of 2 or not.</a>
* 1.4 Learn how to use bitwise operators to <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Projects/blob/master/ft_ls/srcs/parsing.c">save memory when parsing.</a>
* 1.5 Learn <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators/blob/master/1.5_clear_all_bits.c">how to clear all bits.</a>
* 1.6 Check <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators/blob/master/1.6_binary_gap.c">the binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.</a>
* 1.7 Learn <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Bitwise_Operators/blob/master/1.7_align_size.c">how use bit shifts and bit mask to align the size of a given number.</a>
