## Purpose
I created these files as a way to better understand bitwise operators and practical use
When developers are challenged by memory limitation or have high speed requirement as for
embedded systems (FR : systemes embarques) like drones, bitwise operators come in handy.

* 1.0 Introduction to Bitwises operators.
* 1.1 Learn how to <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Exam/tree/master/2-4-print_bits">print (display) bits.</a>
* 1.2 Learn how to <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Projects/blob/master/filler/srcs/main.c">reverse a byte.</a>
* 1.3 Check if a number is power of 2 or not.
* 1.4 Learn how to use bitwise operators to <a href ="https://github.com/agavrel/42-Projects/blob/master/ft_ls/srcs/parsing.c">save memory when parsing.</a>
* 1.5 Learn how to clear all bits.
* 1.6 Check the binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.
